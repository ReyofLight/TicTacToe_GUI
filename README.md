# TicTacToe_GUI
As of 12/2/18 and encompassing all previous work/commits: 
This group of files was coursework for a Java Programming course, it was submitted as extra credit in the Spring of 2018, and earned a good grade. I am a good student, and this solution was acceptable to my professor and met all of her criteria. Portions of the code are hers, and I believe I have marked them accordingly. I will check and make sure (and fix it), as I presently cannot remember which bits.  

Since submission, I have made the following changes: 
GUI is now pink. I was experimenting with JavaFX CSS. 

To use: 
Run PlayerInterface
Choose your symbol
Hit start game
Play TicTacToe

Known issues: 
Distracting button placement and sizing issues - The problem seems to be that I cannot "set" the starting dimensions of the buttons. Ideally they would all start out as squares, and stay the same size as the game progresses. I'm also aware that they exist in an awkward place on the screen. 
Tie as an Endgame condition - the console throws up when you play a tie game. It's unclear whether the exceptions it throws are actually problems which interfere with the running of the program, but you appear to be able to continue playing (via the play again button) after these exceptions pop up. The observable issue for any user (there aren't any) is that the "message to player" at the bottom of the window does not change when you tie. 

Stuff I plan to improve: 
The message to player needs to be bigger and more accurate
buttons
Maybe not pink
more attractive layout for GUI, window sizing and general feng shui

If anyone is actually reading this: I know there is nearly no point to me writing this. However, it seems good practice. Please attempt to contact me with feedback if you have any, and I will update as I fix things. I'm doing this for me, and for practice.
